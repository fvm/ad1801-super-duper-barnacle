# Advent of Code 2018
Solutions and attempts at them

## Priorities
In order, approach to solutions...

### Language
Try it in Go first, Kotlin => Java second, Python third (because I'll probably not get it to work and Python fixes everything with `import allTheThings` and done).

### Toolset
Try it with as little frameworks or external tools as possible, except for build toolchains and utilities like logging, annotations, etc.

### Speed before readability
Because speed is key here, I'll sacrifice readability for speed.

### Experiments and Elegance
Fair chance that I'll forego an easy solution for something cool or elegant, e.g. run a simple problem on a full-blown Kubernetes cluster or rewrite something to a one-liner.
