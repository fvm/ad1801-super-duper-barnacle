# Advent of Code 2018
Solutions for [2018's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) challenges and attempts at them

## Purpose and Priorities
First, no pretension of even coming close to getting high in any leaderboard.

Second, I see this is as a nice way of solving puzzles and improving my problem-solving and programming skills.

Third, I want this to be fun, so I might just skip one or two and, in order, I'll approach any solutions...

### Language
Try it in Go first, Kotlin => Java second, Python as a last resort (because I'll probably not get the solution earlier and Python allows anybody to just `from allTheThings import WhateverYouNeed`...).

### Toolset
Try it with as little frameworks or external tools as possible, except for build toolchains and utilities like logging, annotations, etc.

### Speed Before Readability
Because speed is key here, I'll sacrifice readability for speed.

### Experiments and Elegance
Fair chance that I'll forego an easy solution for something cool or elegant, e.g. run a simple problem on a full-blown Kubernetes cluster or rewrite something to a one-liner.
